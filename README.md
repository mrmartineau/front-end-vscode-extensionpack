# Front-end VSCode Extension Pack

A collection of extensions for working with Front-end Applications in VS Code

These are some of my favorite extensions to make front-end application development easier and fun.

## Extensions Included

* [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) - Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tag, same as Visual Studio IDE does.
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Never worry about formatting your code ever again, keep everything consistent with ease. My suggestion is to add `"editor.tabCompletion": true, "editor.formatOnSave": true,` to your settings file in preferences.
* [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks) - Adds a bookmark to places you designate in your file, and allows you to quickly jump between them. Super helpful. Type `command + opt + K` to create a bookmark and `command + opt + J` to jump between them ðŸ”–
* [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) - EditorConfig Support for Visual Studio Code
* [ES6 Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets) - quickly spin up ES6 JavaScript with only 3 or 4 characters
* [File Utils](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sleistner.vscode-fileutils) - A convenient way of creating, duplicating, moving, renaming and deleting files and directories.
* [Find all references](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gayanhewa.referenceshelper) - Find all references for almost all files.
* [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) - Display import/require package size in the editor
* [JavaScript and TypeScript IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.javascript-typescript) - JavaScript and TypeScript IntelliSense through the Language Server Protocol
* [Jumpy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.vscode-jumpy) - We lose a lot of time scanning with a mouse, time we can get back by using our keyboard instead. Jumpy provides fast cursor movement by giving you a couple of keys that offer a hook to get to another part of the document.
* [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager) - Easily switch between, and manage projects
* [Relative Path](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakob101.RelativePath) - Get relative url paths from files in the current workspace.
* [Sublime Babel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.sublime-babel-vscode) - Sublime Text's babel-sublime grammar in VS Code.
